# Coursework of Machine Learning

## Assignment 1: Decision Tree classification

The program will calculate the entropy and information gain required by the Decision Tree algorithm.  It will learn the known data and predict for the unknown.

However, it is not yet designed to handle internal collisions within the training dataset.  The output is uncertain when incorrect intput occurs.
